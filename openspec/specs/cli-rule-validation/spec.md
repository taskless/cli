# cli-rule-validation Specification

## Purpose

TBD - created by archiving change self-contained-rules. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Rules are validated and tested by path, not by id

The CLI SHALL provide `verify <path>` and `test <path>`. Both SHALL accept a path to a rule's canonical location or to any directory above it, and SHALL resolve the owning engine from the path's position under `.taskless/rules/<engine>/` rather than by parsing the file.

An id does not name one thing. The same id can exist under `sg` and under `vale`, so an id-addressed command has to either guess or report an ambiguity; a path has neither problem. Resolving the engine from position — never from content — is the same rule dispatch follows, so a rule cannot be validated by one engine and executed by another.

#### Scenario: A rule path resolves to its engine

- **WHEN** `verify .taskless/rules/vale/no-simply` is run
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL validate it as a Vale rule

#### Scenario: The same id under two engines is not ambiguous

- **WHEN** `no-simply` exists under both `rules/sg/` and `rules/vale/`
- **THEN** each is addressed by its own path
- **AND** neither command SHALL require the user to disambiguate

#### Scenario: A directory means everything beneath it

- **WHEN** `verify .taskless/` is run
- **THEN** every rule beneath it SHALL be validated, each against its own engine
- **AND** the command SHALL report per-rule results rather than a single pass or fail

#### Scenario: A path outside any engine's rules directory is rejected

- **WHEN** a path resolves to no engine
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL exit non-zero naming the path, rather than guessing an engine

### Requirement: Verify checks a rule's required components

`verify` SHALL check that a rule has the components its engine requires and that they are well formed, and SHALL NOT require fixtures or test cases to exist.

The two commands split because they have different preconditions. An agent part-way through authoring has a rule and no fixtures yet, and needs to know the rule itself is valid before it can write a meaningful test for it.

Per engine, `verify` SHALL check:

| Engine    | Components                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sg`      | `<id>.yml` against the ast-grep schema and the Taskless required fields                              |
| `vale`    | `<id>.yml` against the Vale rule schema and the Taskless required fields, and the rule's `.vale.ini` |
| `runtime` | `check.ts` present, and at least one capture rule under `captures/`                                  |

The `vale` row previously read "against Vale's own validation." Measured against the pinned 3.18.0 binary, that covers less than it claims: `level: bananas` is reported, while `extends: nonsense` and `scope: fenced` both verify clean and produce a rule that matches nothing. Vale validates a rule when it _runs_ one, and it runs one field at a time — so a name it does not recognize is not an error, it is a check that never fires. Schema validation is therefore its own layer for `vale`, as it already is for `sg`.

#### Scenario: A rule with no fixtures still verifies

- **WHEN** `verify` runs against a rule whose fixture buckets are empty or absent
- **THEN** it SHALL report on the rule's components only
- **AND** the absence of fixtures SHALL NOT be a verify failure

#### Scenario: A malformed rule reports its own error

- **WHEN** a Vale style declares a `level` outside `suggestion`/`warning`/`error`
- **THEN** `verify` SHALL report that error, naming the field

#### Scenario: An unrecognized extension point is rejected

- **WHEN** a Vale style declares an `extends` that is not one of Vale's check types
- **THEN** `verify` SHALL report it, naming the field and the accepted values
- **AND** it SHALL NOT report the rule as valid

#### Scenario: An unrecognized scope is rejected

- **WHEN** a Vale style declares a `scope` that is not one of Vale's scope values
- **THEN** `verify` SHALL report it, naming the field
- **AND** a scope using the `~` negation or `&` chaining syntax over recognized values SHALL be accepted

#### Scenario: A field belonging to another check type is rejected

- **WHEN** a Vale style declares a field its `extends` does not accept, such as `tokens` on an `occurrence` check
- **THEN** `verify` SHALL report it before Vale is invoked

The failure it prevents is not a local one: Vale reports this as `E201: has invalid keys` and reads one assembled config per run, so a single rule with a stray field suppresses every other Vale rule's findings.

### Requirement: Test runs a rule's fixtures and runs verify first

`test` SHALL execute a rule against its test material — ast-grep test cases, Vale `pass`/`fail` fixture buckets, or the runtime harness — and SHALL run `verify` first, stopping on a verify failure without running the fixtures.

Ordering is the point. When a rule is both malformed and under-fixtured, the fixture complaint is the less useful of the two errors and is the one that surfaces first if the checks run in the other order — so the author is told their fixtures are incomplete while the reason the rule could never have run goes unmentioned.

A rule that populates only one bucket has proved only half of what a rule claims, whatever its engine. An engine SHALL NOT be trusted to report this itself: `ast-grep test` reports an empty `invalid:` bucket as `1 passed; 0 failed` and exits zero, so a rule that has never matched anything is indistinguishable from one that passed.

#### Scenario: A malformed rule reports the malformation, not the fixtures

- **WHEN** `test` runs against a rule that is both invalid and missing a fixture bucket
- **THEN** it SHALL report the validation error
- **AND** it SHALL NOT report the fixture coverage as the failure

#### Scenario: Vale fixtures are tested per bucket

- **WHEN** `test` runs against a Vale rule
- **THEN** every `fail/` document SHALL produce at least one finding for that rule
- **AND** every `pass/` document SHALL produce none
- **AND** a rule populating only one bucket SHALL be reported as unverified rather than passing

#### Scenario: ast-grep fixtures are counted per bucket

- **WHEN** `test` runs against an ast-grep rule
- **THEN** the `valid:` and `invalid:` entries SHALL be counted across every `-test.yml` file the rule owns
- **AND** a rule populating only one bucket SHALL be reported as unverified rather than passing
- **AND** a rule whose buckets are all empty or absent SHALL be reported as unverified rather than passing
- **AND** a green `ast-grep test` run SHALL NOT on its own be sufficient to report the rule as passing

### Requirement: The generation loop runs verify and test

The rule generation loop SHALL run `verify` and then `test` against a newly authored or newly delivered rule, and SHALL treat a failure of either as a rule that is not ready to report as complete.

#### Scenario: A generated rule is checked before it is reported

- **WHEN** a rule is authored locally or written by the service
- **THEN** the loop SHALL run `verify` and `test` against its path
- **AND** SHALL surface a failure rather than reporting the rule as written

### Requirement: The Vale rule schema is pinned to the vendored binary

The Vale rule schema SHALL be authored in this repository and pinned to `VALE_VERSION`, and a vendor-contract test SHALL hold its claims against the vendored binary.

Vale publishes no JSON Schema for its check types. The machine-readable field knowledge exists only behind its hosted MCP server, which is a paid product and unavailable to `verify`. The schema is therefore a transcription, and a transcription drifts — so the binary, not the documentation, SHALL be the authority for what the schema asserts.

#### Scenario: A Vale upgrade that invalidates the schema fails loudly

- **WHEN** `VALE_VERSION` is raised to a version whose accepted check types or scopes differ from the schema
- **THEN** the vendor-contract test SHALL fail
- **AND** the failure SHALL name the field whose accepted values changed

#### Scenario: The schema is not derived from documentation alone

- **WHEN** a value is added to the schema's `extends` or `scope` enumerations
- **THEN** it SHALL be one the vendored binary was measured accepting
